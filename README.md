# Valentine Surprise App (Frontend Only)

This is a Vite + React frontend project.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open: `http://localhost:5173`

## Environment variables

Current app does not call any backend API.

Use `.env` like this:

```env
VITE_API_URL=
```

Only set `VITE_API_URL` (for example with `:5000`) if you actually have a backend running there.
